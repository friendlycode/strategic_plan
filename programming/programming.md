# Programming 
In 2015, Friendly Code held regular hack-night meetings most 1st and 3rd Tuesday of every month. Additionally, the group held an October “re-boot” meeting to re-engage past contributors and generate additional interest among community leadership. These activities have produced a solid foundation on which to build in 2016.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Provide agenda and announce purpose and intent for all Friendly Code meetings prior to their start, by Q1.
- Establish a method to track contribution for both “on-site” and “off-site” work to Friendly Code projects, activities, and initiatives by Q4. 
- Investigate and propose participation opportunities outside of bi-monthly Tuesday night hacknights by Q3.
- Create an annual schedule of events (projects and events spreadsheet) by Q1.
