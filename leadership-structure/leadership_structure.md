# Leadership Structure 
2015 saw the transition of long-time Captain Jonathan Pichot, to a co-captainship of Jean Hanks and Allen Clark. Traci Montgomery and Brian Keeley filled out the roles of Community Organizer and Storyteller, respectively. Subsequently, the Storyteller role is now empty. Additionally, the survey and input session identified the need for further clarification of Friendly Codeâ€™s leadership structure, organization, roles, and responsibilities.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016:
- Leadership team will share minutes from all leadership meetings starting February 2016.
- Establish and agree upon a clear leadership structure by Q3. 
- Establish clearly-defined roles and responsibilities for leadership roles by Q3.
- Establish organizational goals by Q3.
