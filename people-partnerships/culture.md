# Culture
With Friendly Code’s development through 2015 and increase of membership, we have realized a deficiency as well as an opportunity to encourage greater diversity in the organization. Along with this shift in skillsets, background, and interests within new membership it is worth regularly revisiting and reassessing the organization’s vision and purpose. Major questions such as, “Who are we?” and “What do you want to become?” need to be addressed in order to continue striving toward the goals and fulfilling the values of the organization.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Read, understand, and adhere to [Code for America’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). Develop a process for members to share their concerns by Q1, and develop a process for addressing disputes by Q3.
- Create an internal vision statement that defines the culture Friendly Code wishes to foster by Q1.
- Develop an outreach plan by Q3 that seeks to expand participation across all cross-sections of Grand Rapids.
