# Financial Management 

The end of 2015 also saw the end of annual support of brigades by CfA, which historically represented about $5,500 annually. The vast majority of this money was used on hack night refreshments. With fundraising now the responsibility of brigades, Friendly Code believes that it should in turn develop an appropriate financial management system of transparency, spending controls, and spending priorities.

- Develop a budget using the tools provided by CfA by the end of Q3.
