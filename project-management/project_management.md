The membership survey and input session identified a need for additional attention dedicated to Friendly Code’s project management processes. In 2015, Friendly Code advanced numerous membership-initiated projects, but none were considered fully “complete and delivered.” While the projects demonstrate the breadth of interest and skills of current membership, additional structure in project management may be needed to help complete and deliver some of the group’s projects. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016:
- Establish a project timeline and tracking system by Q2.  
- Identify a method to communicate the skill or task needs on individual projects by Q2.
- Establish a project proposal template and establish criteria for accepting new projects by Q2.
- A marketing or communications plan will be developed for highlighting projects by end of Q1. 
- Create a plan to motivate non-traditional participation and contribution in projects by Q3.
