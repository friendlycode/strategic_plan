# Fundraising 
In 2015 and previous years, Friendly Code was entirely funded by brigade stipends provided by Code for America. In 2016, this stipend has been discontinued. To continue and expand brigade activities, Friendly Code must find additional sources of revenue to support meetings, outreach, and special events. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016.
- Establish a budget and accounting mechanism by Q3. (Also part of Financial Management section)
- Create fundraising plan by Q4.
