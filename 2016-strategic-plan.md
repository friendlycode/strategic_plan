# Friendly Code Strategic Plan

### February 16, 2016


## Executive Summary 
Friendly Code is growing in numbers, participation, and opportunities. We want to sustain and build on our momentum. Internally we are looking at strengthening our organization so that we can improve on project delivery, care and growth of our members, and create a dynamic organization that can thrive as a Code for America brigade.

Friendly Code will also engage more deeply with the community that it serves through formalizing a partnership with the city of Grand Rapids and working closely on specific priority projects. Friendly Code will also reach out to partner with other community organizations in the Grand Rapids metro area for their subject matter expertise and as partners on events and civic technology projects. 

Friendly Code also reaffirms that the organization and its membership follow the established [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). We believe in providing a friendly atmosphere that encourages everyone to participate in making government services simple, effective, and easy to use. 

## 2015 Recap
[Strategic Plan goals for 2015](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tu2_j-3znUUz5v4ViSMXr2-Ehc7P4pv9Ckjzc95VisE/edit?usp=sharing) were developed through a series of Membership meetings in the Fall of 2014. Friendly Code members spent time considering “At the end of 2015, what accomplishments would make us feel good about our year?” Listed below are the 2015 Strategic Plan goals and how progress was made towards each goal in 2015 based on input from the Survey and Input Session.

- Develop processes that make it easy for new people to get involved while improving membership retention. 
	- An on-boarding document / presentation was developed to inform new members of Friendly Code’s mission, processes, and current projects.
	- Regular bi-weekly meetings were held in addition to a fall membership re-boot in October, 2015 that sought to re-energize former contributors and highlight group accomplishments.
	- Survey results and public input indicate that new member recruitment, especially from underrepresented and minority groups, remains an area where improvement can be made.




- Streamline internal and external communication channels to both easily recruit new members and keep existing members informed and involved.
	- In 2015, Friendly Code moved to using Facebook, Slack, Waffle, and Github to communicate and track progress on projects.
	- Survey and public input session results indicate that partnerships with community leadership has become a significant strength.
	- Through the survey, members indicated that external communication was still a core need.


- Develop and complete 1-2 projects with willing partners that help fill a demonstrated void as expressed by the community or city government.
	- Friendly Code projects can be viewed here.
	- Significant progress was made on the following projects, but no particular project was considered complete and delivered in 2015.
		- Friendly Code webpage
		- GR Parks
		- Kent County Leased Land Parcels
	- Tracking progress and needs on individual projects remains a challenge.


- Identify community support needs, define roles, and fill those roles with interested, capable, and engaged members.
	- With the departure of long-time Captain Jonathan  Pichot, members stepped up to fill the roles of two Co-Captains (one of whom also serves as Development Lead), a community organizer, and a storyteller which is subsequently vacant. 
	- Survey and Input Session results indicate that there may still be some confusion over the responsibilities and interaction between each leadership role. 

## 2016 Priorities
As part of the 2016 strategic planning process, Friendly Code [asked members to complete a survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lg8jVI3IoJbxHm2ukD-0kj5IKBk35Ul6QGAoSJdYBQc/edit?usp=sharing), that asked, among other things, how members felt that the 2015 goals were accomplished. Following the survey Friendly Code held a moderated workshop to discuss the results and work toward identifying broad topics that Friendly Code should focus on for the upcoming year.

Friendly Code’s strategic plan includes the following areas of focus:
- Project Management
- Leadership Structure
- Fundraising
- Programming
- People & Partnerships
- Financial Management 

### Project Management
The membership survey and input session identified a need for additional attention dedicated to Friendly Code’s project management processes. In 2015, Friendly Code advanced numerous membership-initiated projects, but none were considered fully “complete and delivered.” While the projects demonstrate the breadth of interest and skills of current membership, additional structure in project management may be needed to help complete and deliver some of the group’s projects. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016:
- Establish a project timeline and tracking system by Q2.  
- Identify a method to communicate the skill or task needs on individual projects by Q2.
- Establish a project proposal template and establish criteria for accepting new projects by Q2.
- A marketing or communications plan will be developed for highlighting projects by end of Q1. 
- Create a plan to motivate non-traditional participation and contribution in projects by Q3.

### Leadership Structure 
2015 saw the transition of long-time Captain Jonathan Pichot, to a co-captainship of Jean Hanks and Allen Clark. Traci Montgomery and Brian Keeley filled out the roles of Community Organizer and Storyteller, respectively. Subsequently, the Storyteller role is now empty. Additionally, the survey and input session identified the need for further clarification of Friendly Code’s leadership structure, organization, roles, and responsibilities.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016:
- Leadership team will share minutes from all leadership meetings starting February 2016.
- Establish and agree upon a clear leadership structure by Q3. 
- Establish clearly-defined roles and responsibilities for leadership roles by Q3.
- Establish organizational goals by Q3.

### Fundraising 
In 2015 and previous years, Friendly Code was entirely funded by brigade stipends provided by Code for America. In 2016, this stipend has been discontinued. To continue and expand brigade activities, Friendly Code must find additional sources of revenue to support meetings, outreach, and special events. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016.
- Establish a budget and accounting mechanism by Q3. (Also part of Financial Management section)
- Create fundraising plan by Q4. 

### Programming 
In 2015, Friendly Code held regular hack-night meetings most 1st and 3rd Tuesday of every month. Additionally, the group held an October “re-boot” meeting to re-engage past contributors and generate additional interest among community leadership. These activities have produced a solid foundation on which to build in 2016.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Provide agenda and announce purpose and intent for all Friendly Code meetings prior to their start, by Q1.
- Establish a method to track contribution for both “on-site” and “off-site” work to Friendly Code projects, activities, and initiatives by Q4. 
- Investigate and propose participation opportunities outside of bi-monthly Tuesday night hacknights by Q3.
- Create an annual schedule of events (projects and events spreadsheet) by Q1.

### People & Partnerships

#### Culture
With Friendly Code’s development through 2015 and increase of membership, we have realized a deficiency as well as an opportunity to encourage greater diversity in the organization. Along with this shift in skillsets, background, and interests within new membership it is worth regularly revisiting and reassessing the organization’s vision and purpose. Major questions such as, “Who are we?” and “What do you want to become?” need to be addressed in order to continue striving toward the goals and fulfilling the values of the organization.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Read, understand, and adhere to [Code for America’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). Develop a process for members to share their concerns by Q1, and develop a process for addressing disputes by Q3.
- Create an internal vision statement that defines the culture Friendly Code wishes to foster by Q1.
- Develop an outreach plan by Q3 that seeks to expand participation across all cross-sections of Grand Rapids. 

#### Membership
Regular meeting attendance improved in 2015. While familiar faces continue to participate, new members have been welcomed to the group as well. Compared to previous years, location, time, and date of meetings have become more regular with an established meeting format. In 2016, Friendly Code seeks to continue to expand membership and recruit new members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Increase percent of membership who identifies with minority and underrepresented groups in 2016 by Q4 (ongoing). 
- Maintain level of activity of twice monthly meetings with an average of 5 or more participants by Q4 (ongoing).

#### Partnerships
Government and community partnerships are at the core of a successful Code for America Brigade. Friendly Code is fortunate to have good relations within Grand Rapids city government. There are however opportunities to formalize our relationship with the City of Grand Rapids and broaden our outreach to other government entities in our metro area. In 2015 Friendly Code reached out to community organizations, but again more can be done in 2016.
[CfA’s Brigade Organizer Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bN5RWK5nQTpz0mHUViHrzHiommBUAMSztwNRzUcxYo/edit) provides the following guidance.

>Collaborating with government is the central tenet of Code for America’s theory of change, so building strong relationships with government partners is key to building a strong Brigade. Government partners bring subject matter expertise to a Brigade, skills around outreach, public administration, and valuable experience  around solving the toughest problems in our cities. Brigades support local governments by working together on events and civic technology projects. 

>Community organizations are an important part of the equation when tackling the biggest problems in our cities. Community organizations include foundations, social service nonprofits, and educational institutions. These partners bring subject matter expertise to a Brigade, skills around outreach, service delivery, and valuable experience around solving the toughest problems in our cities. Brigades support local community partners by working together on events and civic technology projects. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Develop at least one (1) partnership with an educational institution (e.g. KCAD, GVSU, GRCC) by end of year.
- Formalize (e.g. MOU) relationship with City of Grand Rapids in 2016.
- Develop a list of organizations or potential partners from CfA’s focus areas (Health, Safety and Justice, Economic Development, Communications and Engagement) with whom a mutually  beneficially relationship can be developed by the end of the 2016.

#### Financial Management 

The end of 2015 also saw the end of annual support of brigades by CfA, which historically represented about $5,500 annually. The vast majority of this money was used on hack night refreshments. With fundraising now the responsibility of brigades, Friendly Code believes that it should in turn develop an appropriate financial management system of transparency, spending controls, and spending priorities.

- Develop a budget using the tools provided by CfA by the end of Q3.

- Develop an appropriate financial management system by the end of Q4.
