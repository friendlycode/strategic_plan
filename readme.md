## Friendly Code's Strategic Plan
The final version of [Friendly Code’s Strategic Plan for 2016](https://github.com/friendlycode/strategic_plan/blob/master/2016-strategic-plan.md) was submitted to [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org). As part of the 2016 strategic planning process, [Friendly Code](http://friendlycode.org) asked members to complete a survey, that asked, among other things, how members felt that the 2015 goals were accomplished. Following the survey Friendly Code held a moderated workshop to discuss the results and work toward identifying broad topics that Friendly Code should focus on for the upcoming year.
