# Membership
Regular meeting attendance improved in 2015. While familiar faces continue to participate, new members have been welcomed to the group as well. Compared to previous years, location, time, and date of meetings have become more regular with an established meeting format. In 2016, Friendly Code seeks to continue to expand membership and recruit new members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds.

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Increase percent of membership who identifies with minority and underrepresented groups in 2016 by Q4 (ongoing). 
- Maintain level of activity of twice monthly meetings with an average of 5 or more participants by Q4 (ongoing).
