# Partnerships
Government and community partnerships are at the core of a successful Code for America Brigade. Friendly Code is fortunate to have good relations within Grand Rapids city government. There are however opportunities to formalize our relationship with the City of Grand Rapids and broaden our outreach to other government entities in our metro area. In 2015 Friendly Code reached out to community organizations, but again more can be done in 2016.
[CfA’s Brigade Organizer Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bN5RWK5nQTpz0mHUViHrzHiommBUAMSztwNRzUcxYo/edit) provides the following guidance.

>Collaborating with government is the central tenet of Code for America’s theory of change, so building strong relationships with government partners is key to building a strong Brigade. Government partners bring subject matter expertise to a Brigade, skills around outreach, public administration, and valuable experience  around solving the toughest problems in our cities. Brigades support local governments by working together on events and civic technology projects. 

>Community organizations are an important part of the equation when tackling the biggest problems in our cities. Community organizations include foundations, social service nonprofits, and educational institutions. These partners bring subject matter expertise to a Brigade, skills around outreach, service delivery, and valuable experience around solving the toughest problems in our cities. Brigades support local community partners by working together on events and civic technology projects. 

During the public input session, the following objectives were identified for 2016. 
- Develop at least one (1) partnership with an educational institution (e.g. KCAD, GVSU, GRCC) by end of year.
- Formalize (e.g. MOU) relationship with City of Grand Rapids in 2016.
- Develop a list of organizations or potential partners from CfA’s focus areas (Health, Safety and Justice, Economic Development, Communications and Engagement) with whom a mutually  beneficially relationship can be developed by the end of the 2016.
